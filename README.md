I've done all "must" conditions: 
- Displayed all required information
- The first page is presented using UIViewController and Storyboard, the detailed page is created using SwiftU. Both pages have loading indicators
- Using MVVM architecture, Alamofire for the Network, supporting iPad using size classes, Autolayout
- Nice to have: Unit Test and Combine
